this repo follow the UFLDL tutorial on linear autoencoder. 
The training set is no longer MNIST, but the interesting 3 channel RGB image. 


1. ============================================
the overall training only has finetune, meaning, for this autoencoder, we don't do the layer-wise pretrainning. just run the 45min finetune. using 100k samples.

2. ==========================================
run the validate_cost_grad_func.m  to check if the cost function and the gradient computations are correct. 

3. ==========================
with 400 iterations, the run time is ~900s = ~15min. 

4.========================================
